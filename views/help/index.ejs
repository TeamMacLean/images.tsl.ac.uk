      Naming stuff in this image database
    </h2>

    <p>
      You're going to be asked to choose names at
      <span class="is-underlined">four</span> different levels to store data in
      this tool.
    </p>

    <p>The four levels are:</p>

    <li>Project</li>
    <li>Sample</li>
    <li>Experiment</li>
    <li>Capture</li>

    <div class="has-text-centered">
      <figure class="image is-inline-block">
        <img src="/img/images_data_model.png" style="max-width: 512px" />
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>
      The data model the database uses is minimal, so there is a lot of
      flexibility in what you can choose at each level. The emphasis here is to
      make it as straightforward as practical to make it possible for a worker
      in your group in the future to find your work without you explicitly
      telling them where it is. And we appreciate that choosing names is hard,
      but don't worry you can't get it wrong. Here are some simple guidelines to
      help you
    </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="title is-4 has-text-centered">Project</h3>

      <p>
        A <b>Project</b> is pretty much equivalent to a research theme within
        your <b>Research Group</b>. This is the biggest umbrella group and many
        researchers will contribute to a single project. Although you may use
        the word project to refer to one part of your PhD or post-doc, that's
        not how we're using it here. We mean something more at the group level.
        It shouldn't take too many words to come up with a project name. If
        there are existing projects in the database, see whether you can add to
        one rather than creating a new one. As such using your own name as the
        name for a project is a very bad idea! Your group and the research theme
        will very likely outlast your tenure here so please use something
        descriptive. It will help your group in the future.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="title is-4 has-text-centered">Sample</h3>

      <p>
        A <b>Sample</b> is a rough heading that is meant to capture the basic
        biological variables and material of your image. Here we're looking at
        things like tissue, organelle or growth conditon. You'll be explicitly
        asked for the organism name and NCBI Taxonomy ID to uniquely identify
        the main organism in the image, you can look it up at NCBI
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy">here</a>. Some times it
        won't be clear exactly what should be in <b>Sample</b> and the next
        layer <b>Experiment</b>. The <b>Sample</b> should contain many
        <b>Experiments</b>
        so use this one to capture the rough aspects that aren't changing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="title is-4 has-text-centered">Experiment</h3>

      <p>
        An <b>Experiment</b> is the next heading that captures the more relevant
        varying biological and technical variables (like the treatment or the
        biological replicate). There could be lots of <b>Experiments</b>
        for a sample.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="title is-4 has-text-centered">Capture</h3>

      <p>
        A <b>Capture</b> is the simplest heading. This is really the images
        themselves, and most Experiments would have one capture. If multiple
        captures are present, then they would likely be technically identical,
        even if they are different images. The experimental variables should be
        identical for all images in the same capture.
